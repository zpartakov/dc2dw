After many years of using the excellent [dotclear](https://dotclear.org/) I finally decided to migrate to another tool. Wordpress was not an alternative, as I wanted more simplicity, and I'm not found with new flat tools such as Hugo, so I've choosen a very good tool that I know well since many years, [dokuwiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki), _aka_ dw.

The problem was: what to do with the ~3K posts I had... Just loose them? Nope. Migrate. But not by hand.

So I wrote this very little & easy php script for converting dotclear posts to dokuwiki files

# required (later, for blogging with dw)

dw plugins:

* [Meta Plugin](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:meta)
* [Blog Plugin](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:blog)
